I attempted to create a BI Page on The top cities according to the news. My first Page was about the violent crime rate compared to the top cities that were listed 
as the population within those cities to display a trend between crime/popularity/population 

My second page was about the differences between the monthly rent due and the average annual salary of a certain state. I used bookmarks to show how there were patterns between
the salary and monthly rent and the outliers that were not within the pattern.
