/*Blake Donahoo June 20, 2021 
Analysis of Single Family Residences in the United States from January 1996 to May 2021.
A few basic calculations on the "RealEstate" Database I created with *.CSV files downloaded from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ .
In preparation for further data manipulation in Jupyter Notebooks and PowerBi/DAX:::

Basic questions and expectations one might ask themselves when reviewing the data:
1) What are the current Top and Bottom Tier Single family residence sales prices as of May of 2021?
2) How big is the gap between the two Tiers?
3) What is the average sales price for any home within the United States?
4) What percentage of change can we see from the earliest data we have to the present (01/1996 - 05/2021)?

5) What is the average change per year that can be observed from the data? 
	avg(high) & avg(low)
5.2) What is the average aggregated change per year? 
	AVG(avg(high),avg(low))

) Create new data table for a (High & Low) price prediction (In any city in the USA) in May 2022 (One Year Forecast) 
	INCLUDING: AverageChangePerYear
