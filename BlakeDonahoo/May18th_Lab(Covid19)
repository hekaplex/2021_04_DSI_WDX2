This is the first report I made to add to the report library for RealData. It's the CDC's reported cases and deaths with a measure of "vaccinations" below it. 
When trying to do reports by state, what I've found is that every state fits the same informational pattern by scale. Lending credence to everyone
that has been made out to be a "conspiracy theorist". Especially now that the CDC has done a massive back-pedal on their once mandatory mask-mandate.
