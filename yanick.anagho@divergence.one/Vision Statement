*Preliminary Vision Statement*

I would like to do a project which entails the following skillsets:
    - Data Modeling
    - Data Transformation (Batch | Streaming) in cloud environments
    - Data Persistence (SQL | NOSQL) in cloud environments
    - Data Science Algorithm | Machine Learning
    - Software version control
    - Rendering & Serving via Web application
    - Continiuos Integration & Continuous Deployment in cloud environments

I think the above skill sets will enable me reinforce knowledge towards being
an architect with data and derivative paths such as
    -Data engineering
    -Data Science
    -Data service via web application
