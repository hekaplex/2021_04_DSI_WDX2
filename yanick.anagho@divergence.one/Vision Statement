*Preliminary Vision Statement*

I would like to do a project which entails the following skillsets:
    - Data Modeling
    - Data Transformation (Batch | Streaming) in cloud environments
    - Data Persistence (SQL | NOSQL) in cloud environments
    - Data Science Algorithm | Machine Learning
    - Software version control
    - Rendering & Serving via Web application
    - Continiuos Integration & Continuous Deployment in cloud environments

I think the above skill sets will enable me reinforce knowledge towards being
an architect with data and derivative paths such as
    -Data engineering
    -Data Science
    -Data service via web application

I am changing the scope of my initial capstone vision and initial data set. My capstone project scope | vision will now center on;
1. Formulating and testing a question based on an identified data set
2. Performing a design of the Power App components of Option 2

This change in data set comes at the heals of the qualitative nature of my initial data set with respect to its intended question. 
I used the World Bank Open Data source to identify data from four African Countries; two with English historical association and the
other two with French historical association. The question here was to identify whether their historical association had a bearing
on their current socio-economic status with respect to certain World Bank indicators or metrics over a period of time since 1960 to present.
The issue with the dataset is the inconsistent availability of metric values for these four countries over the same given period.
