It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I\\'ll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.\\n\\nWell, in leafing through the book\\'s pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\\n\\nexcerpt from Black Diamond:  \"Only one thing is keeping them out of the big leagues, and that is the pigmentation of their skin.\" Shirley Povich washington post',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)',\n",

(Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb, but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird, then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.  So I put it back into its original shape.  Ill save as its a very good stand, and if I get a brush that will work the way I want to suspend the brush, I certainly will use this.\\nwant to\",\n",

The brush that I have fits perfectly into the stand, which is notable, because it did not fit into another stand I had (it was too long).  This stand, however, is probably at least 6 inches tall, so it's going to be hard to find something that does not fit.\\n\\nI do have one gripe, but it's minor.  The slant-bar razor I use flops around a bit, because the stand expects a straight-bar razor.  I can't really fault the stand there, though.

The rubber bottom, while it helps to keep the unit from sliding around, has the added caveat of remaining wet for a long period of time after a shave.  How do you dry it?  I don't know.  Perhaps by turning it on its side until it air dries.  In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.  I guess the unit is okay as long as you can leave it out, but I would still recommend placing it on  a dry paper towel after shaving to prevent mildew from forming and, worse, spreading.

       "  'reviewText': \"This stand is just perfect. It looks great, and the construction is solid, but not it's uncomfortably heavy to lift. It's balanced, so that if you have a heavy safety razor on the one side (like my Merkur 34C, for example), and no brush on the other, the stand is perfectly stable. (Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle. This purchase was an easy decision to make and I'm very happy with it. It keeps my razor out of the reach of my two young children, and looks great too.\",\n",

While the item itself is very sturdy and made out of excellent quality material, it did not fit my shave brush and the razor wouldn\\'t stay on the handle either. I bought it because when I bought my brush, this stand was in the \"Customers also bought...\" box before you check out.  After hearing that, the company immediately responded to correct things. While the stand didn\\'t work out for me, it is a very high quality item. Especially at this price, for solid metal. Before purchasing, make sure your brush and razor are going to fit.

Shop. When it first arrived, I found the connection between the stand and the base was loose. This is trivially fixable -- there\\'s a little screw underneath the base, you just pop the rubber bottom off the base and tighten it), but I somehow managed to miss both that fact and the little note inside the box that explains it and sent it back for a refund with a grumpy comment. Pop! Shop noticed my confusion, and not only managed to explain my mistake to me without ever using the words \"you idiot\" (which is more than I would have been able to do, in their shoes), they sent me another one at no charge. So, thanks to their customer service, I was rescued from my own dumb self. Thanks, Pop! Shop!',\n",

It did not fit my brush handle so I simply place my brush in the fork around the bristles, which works quite well with no negative effects on brush or stand.

       "  'reviewText': \"This brush stand is exactly what I needed to hold my safety razor and brush. The overall weight of the product is 7.9 ounces or 224 grams. The brackets themselves stand about 5 inches above the top of the platform, which is enough room to hold my Maggard Razors 24mm synthetic brush without problems. The larger of the two brackets (for your brush) is 1 and 1/16 inches across, which may be a bit narrow if your brush's handle doesn't have a particularly narrow portion. The smaller bracket is 1/2 inches across. The outer 3/8 in or so of the brackets are bent upwards to prevent your brush or razor from sliding off accidentally. The foam rubber foot is simply press-fit into the metal base, so it can be easily removed to access the screw that connects the base to the stand.\\n\\nOverall, it does its job and is easy to keep clean.\",\n",

I selected it among several on the market and examined it carefully after receiving it. It is exactly what I had hoped for, namely, solid chromed metal, enough weight not to be tippy, able to be screwed apart, hopefully rustproof...we'll see...and able to hold the brush and razor purchased separately.  I might have given it 4 stars if I had been able to use it myself.  If my son-in-law likes it, I'll get this one also for myself as I now have a quality brush given to me in a package of creams, etc., but without a stand.  After only a month of enjoying lathering with a brush, I see that it is definitely necessary to have a stand to hang it upside down to allow water not to sit in and on the handle to eventually corrode the handle and the brush hairs at their base.  The brush needs to air dry hanging down. A quality brush deserves a quality stand.\",\n",

I purchased the Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and the Escali Badger Hair brush and this stand to hold them.  It is a basic stand and it looks nice and feels sturdy.  The base is pretty heavy, which keeps it upright when the brush and razor are resting on it.  The Perfect Deluxe Chrome Razor and Brush Stand hold the Escali and Merkur perfectly.  Since both of these items are very popular, this stand is a nice complement to both items.  The only down side to the stand I see is if you drip water on it, it will get water spots but it can easily be cleaned.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought this stand shortly after changing from canned shaving cream to a beaver brush system to help preserve the brush.  It is a very solid, well constructed hanger for both the brush and some razors.  The razor hanging side does not work for my particular razor (Mach 3 which is a rather dated design by a major manufacturer) but the brush holder is a must to help keep you beaver brush rinsed clean and allowed to dry.  The product comes with instructions for disassembly and thorough cleaning of the stand which I really appreciate.  The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\\nMy primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.  In addition it is well made and based on the quality of construction I anticipate that the finish and the stand will hold up for several years of everyday use.  I took the time to write this because I was impressed with the overall quality which I find to be a rarity these days.',\n",

       "  'This book was very informative, covering all aspects of game.',\n",
       "  'I am already a baseball fan and knew a bit about the Negro leagues, but I learned a lot more reading this book.',\n",
       "  \"This was a good story of the Black leagues. I bought the book to teach in my high school reading class. I found it very informative and exciting. I would recommend to anyone interested in the history of the black leagues. It is well written, unlike a book of facts. The McKissack's continue to write good books for young audiences that can also be enjoyed by adults!\",\n",
       "  'Today I gave a book about the Negro Leagues of Baseball to a traveling friend. Its a book I\\'ve read more than once and felt that my friend would truly enjoy. It felt like giving a gift that you wanted to keep for yourself. I parted with the book knowing that my friend would enjoy reading it on his journey back east. Before giving him the book I spent about thirty minutes flipping through its pages and saying goodbye to some of the stories in it. I know I\\'ll come across the book again, but for me, parting with books is like wishing a friend well on a journey, just as this friend of mine was journeying. Its great to send a visiting friend off with a friendly gift.\\n\\nWell, in leafing through the book\\'s pages I came across a few paragraphs I wanted to retain as a memory of my friend the book. Here below are the book and the lines from it that show in words what the negro baseball players faced every day of their lives; a color barrier that prevented them from gaining national sports recognition as professionals of the game they loved so much, baseball. Though Negro men had proven themselves heroic, capable of soldiering bravely in foreign battles of World War II, America was still treating them as second class citizens or less here at home. Major League Baseball would lead the nation in recovering from its racial prejudicial past. The nation today, even with a Black President, is still playing catch up.\\n\\nexcerpt from Black Diamond:  \"Only one thing is keeping them out of the big leagues, and that is the pigmentation of their skin.\" Shirley Povich washington post',\n",
       "  'The story of race relations in American history is one of lost opportunity.  This concise history of the Negro Baseball Leagues for young adult readers illustrates this basic point.  The book discusses the names, dates, and circumstances of the major figures and events of the flip side of American baseball history. Legendary names such as Josh Gibson, \"Cool Papa\" Bell, and Satchel Page are just a few of the remarkable players who made important contributions to the game.  Among others, they played for teams with names such as The Homestead Grays, The St. Louis Stars, and The Kansas City Monarchs.  The book also tells the story of owners and managers, such names as Negro National League founder Rube Foster and the tough as nails woman owner of the Newark Eagles, Effa Manley spring to mind.  The book also briefly explains how the infamous Jim Crow tradition brought about the Negro Baseball saga.  In 1947, major league baseball was sucessfully integrated and that spelled the doom of the Negro Baseball leagues.  The text includes an ample number of photographs.  To assist younger readers, and for easy reference purposes, a player profile and time line section is provided at the back of the book.  Underlying the historical text, there is the theme that segregated baseball mirrored the nagging problem of racism in America.  A sense of fair play and even-handed justice demands that talent, skill, and just plain style should be celebrated, regardless of race.  To do otherwise cheats everybody of a rewarding experience.  Imagine if the great players of the Negro Baseball Leagues had the chance to play (with or against) the great players of the major leagues.  Consider the void created by lost opportunity.  ;-)',\n",

I'm a little accustomed to getting a mix of art and emotion in my Art Of books, and this book feels like it focuses entirely on the art and leaves the story behind. I also would've liked to see more than one or two pages of Aisling illustrations.\\n\\nThat said, it's pretty much exactly how it's billed, and it's a really pretty (and really big) book that definitely showcases how gorgeous the movie was.

While some art books end up focusing on one aspect of it's respective movie, 'Desiging the Secret of Kells' explores not only how the creators painstakingly captured its beautiful art style, but also looks into character design, production process, story boarding and writing, and  much more. From the caption and footnotes in the book tells how much the creators are passionate about and love this masterpiece. Just flipping through this book was a joy. You have to read it to believe it. :>\",\n",

I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it, but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.

In  the meantime, what then to do with one's razor and, more importantly, one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also, this unit is rather tall, so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.

It's balanced, so that if you have a heavy safety razor on the one side (like my Merkur 34C, for example), and no brush on the other, the stand is perfectly stable. (Then again, shaving brushes aren't exactly heavy, are they? They are not. The point is, you don't have to worry about it tipping it over if you don't have a brush yet. And if you don't have a brush yet, you should consider getting one of those next!) But I do in fact store one of my badger-hair brushes on the other side (the German-made one, of course!), and it stays in place pretty well. Much more satisfying than those little plastic stands a lot of brushes come with. The patterned steel in the middle of the stand is also an attractive element, adding visual interest and complementing the similar texture of the razor handle.

I bought it because when I bought my brush, this stand was in the \"Customers also bought...\" box before you check out.  After hearing that, the company immediately responded to correct things. While the stand didn\\'t work out for me, it is a very high quality item. Especially at this price, for solid metal. Before purchasing, make sure your brush and razor are going to fit. If they do, I highly recommend this stand. A shout out to the company for actually caring about their brand. It\\'s so rare to encounter customer service done so well.',\n",

The fact that it does not hold my particular razor does not cause me any real concern because, due to the number of different razor designs on the market these days, I doubt that it is possible to design a system that could work for every conceivable razor on the market.  Who knows, I may change razors next?\\nMy primary use for this stand from the start was to keep the beaver brush clean and to allow it to dry thoroughly between uses and it performs admirably for that purpose.
